# Object-Oriented-Programming-Project2
Object Oriented Programming Project. This is a Hospital Booking System. One of the projects created at the university. Utilized: Java, Eclipse IDE, UML.


When making appointment to visit the hospital, a Patient with Name and patientID makes an Appointment with a Doctor. 
The Doctor can either by a ConsultantDoctor or JuniorDoctor.
After diagnosis, the Doctor will give the Patient a Prescription with Medication or DiscountedMedication and price of each. 
The content of Prescription can be sorted in various ways and total cost can be calculated. Medications in a Prescription can be iterated over and tested for equality. 
The partial UML class diagram below shows the underlying data model you should use to achieve this scenario:
